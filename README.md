# Distil Prithvi

Knowledge distillation of geospatial foundation models.

## TODO
* self.aug is used probably only for inference as dataloader should apply everything when training
* add the following metrics: IoU, mIoU
* add distillation
* check the floods dataset
* use config.yaml files used in the terratorch training process???
